### Project Description
[A Blood Donation Website that connects donors with those in need by providing a seamless registration and login portal. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, it allows users to register as donors, request blood, and find nearby donation centers, ensuring a smooth and efficient blood donation process]

### The Problem statement
[Blood shortages and delays in finding compatible donors often lead to critical health emergencies. The lack of a centralized and efficient platform makes it difficult for patients, hospitals, and blood banks to connect with willing donors in real time. This project aims to develop a Blood Donation Website that streamlines donor registration, facilitates blood requests, and provides an organized database to bridge the gap between donors and recipients efficiently.]

### The Solution
[The Blood Donation Website provides a centralized platform where donors and recipients can connect seamlessly. It allows users to register as blood donors, search for available donors based on blood type and location, and request blood donations in emergencies. The system maintains a secure database using Node.js and MongoDB, ensuring efficient management of donor records. Additionally, it integrates real-time notifications and location-based search features to enhance accessibility and responsiveness, ultimately reducing blood shortages and saving lives.]
